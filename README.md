PCA – Dimensionality Reduction
# Task 13: PCA – Dimensionality Reduction

## Objective
Apply PCA on digits dataset to reduce dimensionality and compare model performance.

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded digits dataset
2. Standardized features
3. Applied PCA with different components
4. Plotted explained variance
5. Trained Logistic Regression on original and reduced data
6. Compared accuracy
7. Visualized 2D PCA plot

## Results
- PCA retained most variance with 30 components
- Accuracy remained comparable after dimensionality reduction

## Tools
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
Digits dataset (similar to MNIST) from sklearn.
